# Outlook Calendar Reporting Console App

## Description
This .NET 8 Console Application retrieves calendar events from Outlook Classic by connecting to the local Outlook client. It authenticates using the Outlook profile on the machine and displays the events in the console. The retrieved data is used to streamline time reporting in SwoDP based on calendar entries and to generate a monthly activity report. 

A project inspired by the calendar synchronization solution with PSA by Rados≈Çaw Mariowski.
